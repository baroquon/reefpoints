As a software consultancy we have a responsibility to our clients to deliver the best solutions. This means thinking
in both economic and technological dimensions. Over the past few years we have seen a very clear and obvious
trend that [Mobile is Eating the World](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/12/8/mobile-is-eating-the-world). Most
other consultancies have seen this trend and have made a knee-jerk reaction that they must start offering mobile development services
for Android and iOS. In many cases this has worked well for them and has allowed them to deliver on those platforms. However,
here at DockYard we take greater consideration with what we hand off to our clients.

There has been overwhelming data compiled over the past few years detailing the costs of building a native application. Those costs are
broken down into development and marketing.

The development of native mobile apps is multiplied by the number of platforms you wish to target.
