For almost two years I've been talking a big game inside DockYard about
opening a San Diego office. The need for this became more apparent after
the winter of early 2015 in Boston. Try recruiting anyone to move to
Boston after hearing about nearly 20 ft of snow being dumped on the
city. So I figured we'll open an office in the nicest place in America.

Having a San Diego office gives us a West Coast presence. Heading up
this effort we've hired [Heather Brysiewicz][heather]. She's been heavily involved
with the tech community in San Diego for a few years now, running the [SD
JS meetup][sdjs] and founding the [SD Ember meetup][sdember]. She recently started
co-organizing the [SD Elixir meetup][sdelixir]. On top of that she's an amazing
engineer.

We're beginning to explore other locations as well. As we continue to
grow some of our existing employees have expressed interest in leaving
Boston. Until recently we held a "Boston-only" policy but over the past six
months we've been experimenting with changing this. Our reluctance lied
within managing client projects with remote devs properly and exporting
our culture. Our team has been working hard to codify many of the
aspects of what it means to work at DockYard but also work with
DockYard. We've come to a good comfort level with remote developers 
and the idea of other "DockYard"s outside of Boston.

Starting today we're now accepting contracts and offering on-site
training for Ember.js and Elixir for the West Coast. <a
