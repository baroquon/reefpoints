Ok, I'll stop.

About four years ago we made a bet on Ember.js as the client side
technology we were going to specialize in. Since then the landscape has
changed quite a bit. I get asked quite a bit why we chose Ember and if
we were making the same decision today would we choose differently.

## Why we chose Ember

We started as a Ruby on Rails shop. When I started DockYard I had
been running BostonRB for a few years, I had spoken at various
Ruby/Rails related conferences, I had released several popular Ruby
gems, I had written quite a bit about Ruby. From the perspective of
marketing I could have been seen as a known quantity in the Rails
community. I wasn't top tier but in Boston I was highly visible and had
a pretty extensive network in that space. However, it turned out that
starting a Rails consultancy in 2011 meant we had missed the party.
Don't get me wrong, DockYard could have been profitable if we stayed
small. The space was already well established with players that have
been building their brand for nearly a decade or more. I believe that
Blade put it best:

Playing catch-up is not a great business strategy. Instead, I like to
position DockYard to get ahead of a trend. If we poisiton ourselves
properly we'll be able to ride the wave of that trend. It takes
significantly less calories to build your brand in a small space than a
large space, if that space grows then your brand will grow at nearly
zero additional cost.

At this time Ember was becoming a "thing". I had seen Yehuda Katz talk
about Amber at a BostonJS meetup a few months prior, and I was playing
with SproutCore in my spare time. I had already ruled out SproutCore as
a viable technology for us but there were some thing I really liked
about it. Thankfully the things I did not like about it Yehuda seems to
be purging from what would eventually become Ember.
