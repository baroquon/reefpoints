We have been pretty busy here at DockYard and I haven't had a chance to
follow up on the [previous post](https://dockyard.com/blog/2011/12/04/its-not-a-vacation.html)

To recap: DockYard is a distributed team, we decided to switch it up for
a week and go to the same city and work our asses off.

Result: We kicked ass.

The city we chose to work from for the week is Providence, RI. It was
close enough most of the team to not be expensive to travel to yet far
enough away to necessitate not going home each night. On top of that,
Providence is a very affordable city and it has a tech scene that is
starting to take off.

For the week we worked from [Tazza Cafe](http://tazzacaffe.com) and I
have only the highest praise for the atmosphere, the food, and the
staff. Free wi-fi, never too crowded, amazing food selection, and some
of the friendliest wait staff I've ever seen at anywhere. If you in the
area, or just passing through, I highly recommend stopping in.

The progress we made during the week was pretty amazing. This type of
work is only possible with a great team. We were
fortuante enough to be joined by [Dan
Pickett](http://enlightsolutions.com) along with the DockYard regulars
of [Angelo Simeoni](http://cssboy.com), [Russ
Jones](http://codeofficer.com), and myself.

During the week we got to meet many from the local tech scene. Monday
night we crashed a [Betaspring](http://betaspring) event and Thursday we
hosted our own Providence Pub Crawl hitting [AS220](http://as220.org/),
[Trinity Brewhouse](http://www.trinitybrewhouse.com), Union Station
Brewery, [Rira](http://www.trinitybrewhouse.com), and ending up at
Tazza. It was a great way to end a great week. We'll be doing this again
in the future.
