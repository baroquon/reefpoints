I often struggle to describe what it is that I do for a living. You may
feel the same, especially when talking to friends outside of your
industry, or at any given family gathering. In the past few months, a
large and I believe most important part of my job at DockYard was
helping get projects started right.

*A stereotypical UX designer at work. Sticky notes in bright colors are essential.*

We call this initial phase of a project design discovery, and believe
that a design-first approach saves a lot of money and frustration by
figuring everything out with the simplest paper-and-pen prototypes
first. But I’m not talking about the business logic, or methods that
inform discovery right now. I want to talk about how it feels to be part
of it - from the beginning, staring at a bunch of unknowns, and right
through the end when the answer becomes clear.

Among all the things I do, the activity of kicking off projects is the
hardest one to describe. It’s the thing that needs to happen before
anyone can start making the *actual* thing. Before you’ve done a
discovery, you mostly have questions, or rather, you have questions
about what the questions should be. (After all, asking the correct
question is 80% of solving a problem.) Then, as you work through user
flows and specific screens the answers start to become more obvious, and
you can make decisions together with the client about what the thing
you’re building should do, and which features you’ll build first to make
that possible.

*Feeling “done” with discovering something doesn’t always look complex.*

If all goes well, the end result should look suspiciously simple.
Obvious, even. You’ll have gotten rid of many creative but complex
features. Those would be nice to have in the future,  but it doesn’t
make sense to invest in the bells and whistles until you’ve built the
basics. The outcome of a Discovery can feel like the outcome of a good
summer vacation. You’ve done some (but not all) of all the possible
things you’d imagined you’d do. You’ve had to narrow down your long list
of fuzzy imagined dream-like things you could possibly do to a realistic
and actionable schedule.

Discovery is a process that turns a strong desire to have a vacation,
plus a list of ideas and dreams into something you can reliably act
upon. If the end of summer has ever hit you by surprise, as you realized
you’d never made time for the one important trip you’d definitely
thought you’d do this year - planning could help.

And if you’re an entrepreneur, or a UX designer, or even an engineer
about to embark on a discovery process, this is how it should feel.

**And in the beginning**, it’s open and exciting but often so open it’s
scary. Your collaborators keep asking seemingly obvious questions.  (We
uncover a new and important motivation every single time. It’s worth the
time and effort.) It can be frustrating because the things you thought
were clear still need definition. Things can even get heated, as you
discuss the details of a collaborative project and realize your
assumptions might be different from your collaborators’, and also
different from the assumptions your users hold. The early stages of a
discovery are like the beginning, dreamy stages of planning a vacation.
You know a good thing is ahead, and you can spend some time with all the
possible amazing options open to you, but know that the longer you delay
the decisions, the longer you wait to do the actual thing.

**In the middle**, it’s hard. You’re making tough decisions to
prioritize among ideas and features, while you care and see the need for
all of them. (Eventually).

**At the end**, things look obvious - so obvious that you can’t wait to
get started actually making them. You know exactly what to do first.

Enjoy the rest of the summer! (Remember, officially, we have till
September 21st :-)
