[Cruising World](http://www.cruisingworld.com/) the go-to site and magazine for sailing enthusiasts, recently named [DockYard’s Progressive Web App, High Tide, ‘App of the Month’](http://www.cruisingworld.com/app-month-high-tide). 

The magazine’s praise for [High Tide](https://hightide.earth/) included some of the most lauded Progressive Web App (PWA) features and benefits: add to homescreen, push notifications, and elimination of the antiquated requirements of downloading, updating, and relinquishing space to an app. 

With the launch of High Tide, [DockYard](https://dockyard.com/) announced that they will be focusing on a specialized service in their catalog: the development of PWAs. High Tide was developed to contextualize [the benefits of PWAs](https://dockyard.com/blog/categories/progressive-web-apps), providing a straight-forward, beautiful example for those seeking to test drive a PWA, on both desktop and mobile environments.

PWAs have gained popularity recently as businesses seek solutions to the high costs of creating, maintaining, and re-engaging users through a mobile application. Progressive Web Apps alleviate these issues by using the web browser as their primary platform, while still providing the functionality and ease of use of a native app.
