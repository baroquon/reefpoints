DockYard has been investing in the Elixir eco-system since we first adopted Elixir nearly four years ago. Over the past
three years we have been the Platinum Sponsor at [ElixirConf](https://elixirconf.com) and nearly two years ago we became the Sponsor
for the [Phoenix Framework](http://phoenixframework.org/) when we hired [Chris McCord](https://twitter.com/chris_mccord) to work on Phoenix nearly year-round.

Today we're proud to announce that we are extending our investment in Elixir by seeking an Elixir dev to lead the development for a first-class Elixir deployment
library. This project will have direct oversign by [Jos√© Valim](https://twitter.com/josevalim). We plan to make the result of this effort 100% Open Source.

Please see our recent ElixirConf announcement:

### Why are we interested in Deployment?

Over the past few years we have been incredibly impressed with how mature the Elixir tooling and great app eco-system has developed. When we are faced with
evangelizing Elixir into communities and companies most questions are easy to answer. However, the one question that is always difficult to answer is the one
around deployment. There have been some very good efforts around deployment in Elixir to date but too often they fall short of the level of ease we've come to expect
from the other aspects of Elixir.

DockYard is in a unique position where we will significantly benefit from having a first-class build and release system for Elixir. It will make our jobs easier
for estimating, building, and maintaining our client apps. We believe in the power of Open Source and know that this effort won't be complete without community
involvement so we are more than happy to make the result of this effort freely available.

### Who are we seeking?

We'd like to source ideas and applications fro the community. We have a general idea around the architecture for this. But deployment is a complex issue. This will
be a challenge no doubt. But one that we are confident that Elixir itself will make easier than it would be otherwise in other languages.
