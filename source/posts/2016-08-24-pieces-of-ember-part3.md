This is part 3 of a 3 part series on pieces of [Ember][ember]. It is also a continuation or elaboration of a lightning talk I gave at the July [SanDiego.js Community][sandiegojs] event which can be found [here][sdjs-talk].

* Part 1: RSVP and Broccoli
* Part 2: Route-recognizer and Router
* Part 3: Handlebars and HTMLBars

To review, the pieces of the ember ecosystem that are covered in this series are:

* [tildeio/rsvp.js][rsvp]
* [broccolijs/broccoli][broccoli]
* [tildeio/route-recognizer][route-recognizer]
* [tildeio/router.js][router]
* [wycats/handlebars.js][handlebars]
* [tildeio/htmlbars][htmlbars]

These pieces of ember would be able to provide any JavaScript project with:

* Promises
* Build tools
* Routing capabilities
* View templating
* Templating with Virtual DOM

All without the need to buy into the entire ember ecosystem.
