Leading up to this year's EmberConf I wasn't sure if I was going to attend. My indecisiveness
had nothing to do with concerns about Ember or DockYard's commitment to
the framework. It was simply that I personally haven't been writing much
Ember over the past six months. Between being a new dad, buying a house, running
DockYard, and exploring Elixir I lacked the badwidth to keep up with
what has been happening in Ember. I guess I was having a bout of
imposter syndrome.

Ultimately, the deciding factor was to lend moral support to two of our
engineers who were speaking: Estelle DeBLois and Lauren Tan. They both
gave great talks and if that was the only reason it would have been more
than worth the trip. However, like many things, I was thankfully wrong
about my conerns attending and would like to share my experience this
year.

First, I'd like to point out how great of a job Leah Silber has done
building and organizing EmberConf. This year the attendance was just shy
of 1,000. That's almost double from last year. I've heard the aim is for
1,500 next year. As someone who has run a few conferences I can say that
Leah has been kicking ass.

My time was split about 50/50 between the hallway track and the talks. Tom &
Yehuda's keynote was probably my favorite talk as we're very interested
in the mobile web becoming more competitive against native. I hope elements
of that keynote should play out over the next year or so to help
position Ember as the best choice for progressive web applications.

I was really impressed with how many people were interested in Elixir.
Easily a majority of the conversations I had were with people 
curious about Elixir or actively using it. I don't want to dwell on
Elixir too much because this was EmberConf but this reinforced my
opinion that Elixir/Phoenix are a natural fit for Ember backends. It
seems there are many people out there that have the same idea.

This is now my fourth EmberConf (if I'm counting the original
EmberCamp) and catching up with old friends is important but I really
enjoyed meeting new people. As always, the regret is not meeting enough
people. I wish that future EmberConfs were more days with more down time. I
realize this is not realistic as the days really increase the cost to 
run the conference and
more down time creates less incentive for companies to send employees,
but I personally find the most value from networking.

I am aware of DockYard's position in the Ember community. Thinking
back to the earlier Rails days, and companies that were in a similiar
position to DockYard, I don't recall the leaders of those companies being
very accessible. There were clear social cliques that these people
stuck to. I'm trying not to repeat that. At times I found
myself gravitating towards friends but after a few minutes I'd excuse
myself so I could meet new people.


I'll ends this with a few pictures
