Leading up to this year's [EmberConf][emberconf] I wasn't sure I was going to attend.
My indecisiveness had nothing to do with concerns about Ember or DockYard's
commitment to the framework. It was simply that I personally haven't been
writing much Ember over the past six months. Between being a new dad, buying
a house, running DockYard, and exploring Elixir I lacked the badwidth to
keep up with what has been happening in Ember.

The deciding factor was to lend moral support for two of our
engineers who were speaking: [Estelle DeBLois][estelle] and [Lauren Tan][lauren]. They both
gave great talks and if that was the only reason it would have been more
than worth the trip. However, like many things, I was thankfully wrong
about my conerns attending and would like to share my experience this
year.

First, I'd like to point out how great of a job [Leah Silber][leah] has done
building and organizing EmberConf. This year the attendance was just shy
of 1,000. That's almost double from last year. I've heard the aim is for
1,500 next year. As someone who has run a few conferences I can say that
Leah has been kicking ass.

My time was split about 50/50 between the hallway track and the talks. [Tom][tom] &
[Yehuda's][yehuda] keynote was probably my favorite talk as we're very interested
in the mobile web becoming more competitive against native. Elements
of that keynote should play out over the next year or so to help
position Ember as the best choice for [Progressive Web
Applications][pwa].

I was really impressed with how many people were interested in
[Elixir][elixir].
Easily a majority of the conversations I had were with people 
curious about Elixir or actively using it. I don't want to dwell on
Elixir too much because this was EmberConf but this reinforced my
opinion that Elixir/Phoenix are a natural fit for Ember backends. It
seems there are many people out there that have the same idea.

This is now my fourth EmberConf (if I'm counting the original
[EmberCamp][embercamp]) and catching up with old friends is important but I really
enjoyed meeting new people. As always, the regret is not meeting enough
people. I wish that future EmberConfs were more days with more down time. I
realize this is not realistic as the days really increase the cost to 
run the conference and
more down time creates less incentive for companies to send employees,
but I personally find the most value from networking.

I am aware of DockYard's place in the Ember community. Thinking
back to the earlier [RailsConfs][railsconf], and companies that were in a similiar
position to DockYard, I don't recall the leaders of those companies being
very accessible. There were clear social cliques that these people
stuck to. I'm trying not to repeat that. At times I found
myself gravitating towards friends but after a few minutes I'd excuse
myself so I could meet new people.

Tuesday night we hosted an event at [Ground Kontrol][gk]. For those
unfamiliar, Ground Kontrol is a video arcade with a bar. We rented the
entire space for three hours and had close to 100 EmberConf attendees
through the doors that evening. All the games were free. When I walked
in to get the place ready for the event it was like stepping into a time
machine. Nearly ever coin-op game from my childhood was there. If I
learned anything that evening it is that I vastly over estimated my
skills as kid. Or I am just rusty. Or it was the controller... all of
the controllers. Also, I am really out of touch with modern arcade games
as I was completely unaware of this [Killer Queen][killer-queen] game.

A good conference leaves you feeling energized and wanting more,
EmberConf has done that for me every year. A great conference gives you
the opportunity to connect with friends new and old, and it takes a
great community to build what Ember has. We hear a lot about *Ember vs X*.
Not often enough do I hear the practitioners of other frameworks
bragging about their community the way Ember does. I think there is a
good reason for that. Twenty years from now I'm not going to give a shit
about which library rendered which obscure demo the fastest. But I will
remember...
