Last year's [EmberConf][emberconf] was a conference packed with exciting new things.
The Ember 2.0 release was closing in. A lot of 1.0s of big Ember projects would
be shipped soon. [FastBoot][fastboot] was announced and so was [Glimmer][glimmer].
Our new rendering engine got on par with React's blazingly fast
rendering engine. There was a lot of hype and excitement.

This year the atmosphere of the conference was different. Not a bad different
per se, but different. This year felt as if we had just completed major goals
set out at last year's conference, and that we were now on track to keep leveling
up those achievements in the foreseeable future.

For example, Glimmer II drastically improves upon Glimmer I. The 60fps
rendering demo was mind blowing, but it felt different from seeing for the
first time how comically bad the rendering engine was before Glimmer 1.0 and then
see it run as fast as React's rendering engine. It was already expected
that Glimmer II would improve upon Glimmer I.

There is one big new movement this year. It is the movement of
[Progressive Web Apps][pwa] (_PWA_). FastBoot 1.0 will be released soon and
there are a bunch of other exciting projects putting effort into pairing up
Ember with [ServiceWorkers][sw] and other PWA tools that (recently) have been added
to (mobile) browsers.

Because of these developments I would like to dub this year:

__"Year of Progress and Progressive Web Apps"__.

There is another thing I want to mention: [Living Styleguides][styleguides].
Chris LoPresto gave a talk about this. I did not yet know of this movement
until Luke Melia told me I should go see Chris' talk. It was supposed to be
awesome. I'm glad I followed Luke's advice and went to see Chris' talk.
You may think that styleguides are for designers, but the way these styleguides
are built will actually help developers architect better components.

I had a really good time at EmberConf 2016. I'm excited to start trying out Living
Styleguides at DockYard. We're already using [FastBoot][fastboot-post] and we're
also actively experimenting with Progressive Web App technology.

I look forward to another round of talks that show how the Ember ecosystem has been
improved and solidified in 2017. Also to meet all the wonderful people I've met this
year again.
