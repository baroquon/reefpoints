Boston-based software consultancy [DockYard](https://dockyard.com/) announced today that they will be focusing on a specialized service in their catalog: the development of Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). To help contextualize [the benefits of PWAs](https://dockyard.com/blog/categories/progressive-web-apps), DockYard created a sample [High Tide](https://hightide.earth/), that users can navigate and see for themselves, both on desktop and mobile environments.

PWAs have gained popularity recently as businesses seek solutions to the high costs of creating, maintaining, and re-engaging users through a mobile application. In general, mobile apps see a high abandonment rate and cost per user, while seeing lower user engagement and conversion rates. Progressive Web Apps alleviate these issues by using the web browser as their primary platform, while still providing the functionality and ease of use of a mobile application. 

User benefits of PWAs showcased in DockYard’s sample High Tide app include the ability to add to homescreen, an app-like experience, and push notifications. Overall, PWAs like High Tide provide a fast, light experience allowing users to accomplish a variety of goals without the added step of downloading another mobile application. 

For more information on if a Progressive Web App may be right for your business, or to see DockYard’s High Tide example, please visit DockYard.com.

DockYard is a software consultancy driven by creating exceptional user experiences.
By approaching software with the user experience at the forefront, DockYard delivers web applications that beat out native applications in any web browser using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
