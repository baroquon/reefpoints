Today’s businesses are extremely reliant on the web. Finding and acquiring new customers while engaging and retaining current ones is a costly balancing act requiring more and more bandwidth and budget. 

How can businesses communicate with all customers, across all devices, and in the most cost effective way? Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are not only forward thinking technology but also an answer to issues like this that businesses face on a daily basis. 

**The need to develop and maintain for multiple platforms.** A Progressive Web App works in the browser so there is no need for specialized development. Specifically, Chrome, Opera, and Firefox support PWAs with Safari—while not (yet?) supporting them—[still sees an increase in engagement.](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/aliexpress) When implementing a PWA, many companies like Alibaba see a 76% [increase in conversion across all browsers](https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/alibaba), not only those in which they are completely supported. 

**Mobile applications are not discoverable.** A big barrier to mobile application adoption is that they do not show up in search results. This means that new customers looking for solutions you provide are unable to find you, unless they are already aware of you. By implementing a Progressive Web App the opportunities for new user acquisition are amplified by their ability to find you on their own terms when they need you. Not to mention the fact that [Google rewards mobile-friendly content in it’s search algorithm](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/03/continuing-to-make-web-more-mobile.html). 

**Re-engagement and timely communication is costly (and ‘people don’t read email’).** PWAs allow websites to be added to home screens on mobile devices and receive push notifications. After users opt in they can be provided timely information on sales, abandoned carts, or other information valuable to them at that specific time or location. Push notifications offer users the right information at the right time without the need to check, open, and interact with email. 

**Still, one experience doesn’t fit both desktop and mobile visitor goals.** Should you want to provide a varied experience for your mobile audience this is also supported by Progressive Web Apps. Where your desktop users may be completing tasks focused on research and narrowing solutions, your mobile users may be looking to make decisions and purchases. Providing upfront information on sales, new products, or upcoming events can be spotlighted making it easier for them to move from discovery to purchase. 

**Mobile sites can be slow and not user friendly.** It is true that mobile apps provide a user and device driven experience which many websites are not optimized for. Progressive web apps solve for this by providing an app like feeling to the user without the need to develop for multiple devices. PWAs create a faster, lighter, and interactive way for consumers to interact with a business in a way that makes sense for them. Given that [53% of users will abandon a site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/), speed is a very important consideration. 

Whether combatting a poor mobile experience or trying to reduce long term costs, all businesses can benefit from upgrading to a Progressive Web App. The reduction in overhead and simplification of communication with your key customers are just a couple of ways companies can see the immediate impact of PWA implementation.
