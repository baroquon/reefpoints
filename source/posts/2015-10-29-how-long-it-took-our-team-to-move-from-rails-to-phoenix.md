One week.

That is how long it took for our engineers, who had all (but one) worked
with [Rails][rails] for a few years, to be productive on a new [Phoenix][phoenix] client
project.

I had assigned each of them to read Part 1 of [Dave Thomas' Programming Elixir][book]
book which was only 160 pages of material. Part 1 introduces early
[Functional Programming][fp] concepts and the [Elixir][elixir] standard library. In my
mind, this is enough to make the switch.

At the higher level of writing actions, routes, tests, models, queries, etc... there is so much
overlap with the concepts that exist in Rails that it was simply a
matter of syntax that had to be learned before a Rails engineer could
make contributions back to Phoenix applications.

There is no doubt that Phoenix borrows *a lot* of concepts and structure
from Rails. For good reason, Rails nailed the [MVC app pattern][mvc]. The
benefit here is that a lot of that domain knowledge on how to build
Rails apps can be transferred over to building Phoenix
apps.

Now, don't get me wrong. I am not suggesting that after this one week
that you should be ramped up on the complexities of Elixir and the
Erlang ecosystem. I think there is enough to Erlang that could take
years to fully absorb. But that's not the point.

The best way to write a faster Rails app is to write it in
Phoenix.
