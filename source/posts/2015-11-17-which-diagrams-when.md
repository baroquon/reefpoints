Diagram: (definition) a simplified drawing showing the appearance, structure, or workings of something; a schematic representation.

Mental model: (definition) an explanation of someone's thought process about how something works.


Diagrams are incredibly valuable. They help align understanding between different stakeholders and build a frame of reference for conversation. Diagrams and mental models are different mapping techniques that give visual form to concepts and ideas.

We use various mapping techniques at different stages of the design process. Each technique documents and represents different aspects of the design research process. It is important to know these techniques and when in the process they should be used.

The following examples are types of maps we’ve used here at DockYard for client projects. Each of these mapping techniques will highlight the map type, when in the design process they should be used, and an example. We use OmniGraffle to build these diagrams.


1. Journey Map - Design Research

A journey map is diagram in the form of a timeline, which identifies a user’s arrival and experience of using the product. Journey maps are often developed from a user persona. They help to clarify and understand the context in which someone might interact with a product: why they might seek it out, and the situations or interactions that might occur while using it. 

Journey maps help to refine the use case of a product design, to frame the motivation, need, and experience. Understanding the use case ultimately informs when and where the product is used (decision for desktop, mobile, etc) and defining the majors actions the user might want to take (features).

2. User flow - Product Development

A user flow is a diagram of the actions taken within the product itself. They are generated from the features and major actions defined by the journey map, and build a more detailed interaction of those actions within the context of the product. User flows allow us to break down the step by step interactions that must take place within the product (out of the context of an interface design) for the user to accomplish their goal.

User flows become the basis for sketching and wireframing the interactions with the interface design. They help to identify major screens and navigation paths, by highlighting actions to recur, for example. Understanding these actions and navigation patterns will inform the information architecture and interface design.

2a. Master user flow - Product Development

When we build complex interfaces, they often have multiple use cases. A management user flow might connect to a customer facing interface at various points. When this happens, it is important to document and demonstrate where and when they connect to one another. A Master user flow is a diagram that captures these interdependencies.

3. Insights mapping - User Testing

Usability testing is incredibly valuable to the development of a product. Conducting user tests allows us to observe our target audience’s ability to interact with and comprehend the product in development. User tests are designed around a short task and user flow; a facilitator guides the user through a list of prompts. Having a second facilitator to take notes is very valuable, and they can observe the user’s ease of use, hesitation, confusion, intuition, comments and concerns.

Conducting several user tests can yield a wealth of insights, and all must be taken into account. Similar to the design research insights mapping matrix, we can once again begin to cluster patterns of insights from our usability testing results.

For iteration documentation and planning, it is valuable to create an insights map that highlights where changes will be made to the prototype.

Knowing when and how to incorporate mapping techniques is very valuable to your process. Maps are good for documentation and tracking decisions throughout the process. They support discussion around problem solving, and can clarify that all stakeholders in the conversation share a common understanding of the solution.

Here are some of my favorite resources about diagrams and mental models.
