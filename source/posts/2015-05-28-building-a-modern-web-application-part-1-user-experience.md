In today's competitive web application market it is actually rare to
have a truly unique idea. It is even more rare to have a unique idea
that isn't quickly being immitated. The one differntiator that can truly
set your product apart from the competition and give you the best chance
of *winning* is **User Experience**.

In this part of our multi-part series on Modern Web Applications we'll
go over what User Experience means within the context of the web and how
you can hope to build out competitive experience for your customers.
In our years of building great User Experiences for our clients there
has always been one feature that consistently leads to happy users:
Speed.

A *User Experience* itself can be a broad term but for our purposes we
will simply define it as *how your users experience your product*. This
definition does not include any mention of technology or design.
Depending upon the context that experience can mean many different
things. In many cases the technology and design trends at the time can
also help dictate the best experience.

On the web one of the primary experiences your users will be subjected
to is *response time*, meaning how long does it take your application to
respond to a user's action. According to [Jakob
Nielson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Nielsen_%28usability_consultant%29)
there 3 main time limits to keep in mind on the web:

* **0.1 second** is about the limit for having the user feel that the system
is reacting instantaneously, meaning that no special feedback is
necessary except to display the result.
* **1.0 second** is about the limit for the user's flow of thought to stay
uninterrupted, even though the user will notice the delay. Normally, no
special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less
than 1.0 second, but the user does lose the feeling of operating
directly on the data.
* **10 seconds** is about the limit for keeping the user's attention focused
on the dialogue. For longer delays, users will want to perform other
tasks while waiting for the computer to finish, so they should be given
feedback indicating when the computer expects to be done. Feedback
during the delay is especially important if the response time is likely
to be highly variable, since users will then not know what to expect.

Jakob has done the research for you and we all benefit from it. Clearly
we want to aim for as fast an experience as possible. Part 2 of this
series will discuss Single Page Applications and how we believe they
offer the fastest possible in-browser experience possible. In Part 3 we
discuss backend technologies and share with you an emerging technology
that is so fast and reliable that we've abandonded the industry standard in favor of
this new technology.

Speed is more than just the technology decisions you make. Speed
comes down to *how fast do I perceive this application to be?* Let's
imagine an application where we click from one page to another. The
transition takes 1 second. We're right at the poing Jakob outlined on
when the user begins to feel the delays in our application. Now imagine
a second application that actually shows an animation during the
transition. From start to finish the entire transition still takes the
same amount of time, however the user's *perception* is the 2nd
application is faster because something is happening in between. The
absesnce of action allows the user to be aware of the delay.

When it comes to crafting the User Experience for your application you
really need to consider how users are perceiving the application. But
how can you capture this information? This is where User Research comes
in. The topic of User Research is a large one and we'll cover that in a
separate series on [Designing A Modern Web Application]().

User Experience is a very deep topic, one that we've only begun to
scratch the surface of. If you'd like to learn more about User
Experience and how this approach can create a high-impact for your
product we'd be very happy to chat with you.
