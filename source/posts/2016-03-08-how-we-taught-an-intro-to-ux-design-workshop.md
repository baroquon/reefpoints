Earlier this week, my colleague [Amanda](https://twitter.com/acacheung) and I taught a workshop for the
[Northeastern University Women in Tech
group](http://nuwit.ccs.neu.edu/index.html). More than 35 computer
science majors, as well as designers and inter-media studies students
joined us for two hours of hands-on learning.

By presenting this workshop, we got a chance to meet and collaborate
with a great bunch of motivated students, and learned a few things
ourselves!

## You can learn fast when you start with a common background

A big portion of the workshop consisted of a hands-on exercise:
the participants conducted [design sprints](https://dockyard.com/design-sprints) from user interviews to screen
flows. The constraints were that our audience was generally new to UX
design and the workshop was to fit in a one hour timeframe. We started
with an [introductory UX design presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/rgbcolor/intro-to-ux-design-a-dockyard-workshop) and then posed our workshop
prompt. The hypothetical client and problem set was intimately familiar
to all of the participants: the Boston MBTA.

Participants switched between end-user and interviewer roles, and
conducted quick interviews to find problems to solve. The process went
very smoothly and had quite a few laughs, as we all shared painful
experiences we’ve all had on the clunky and crowded transit system.

## When in doubt, propose a magical solution

Because the goal of the workshop was an introduction to the whole UX
design process, rather than a refinement of a particular skill, we
decided to move away from any potential time-consuming sticking points
like detailed research or gathering real data.

Our demo: the low-fidelity presentation of UX problems and solutions for
a unicorn to find a compatible public transit car.

As an example outcome, we demonstrated a UX design proposal that solves
the problem a unicorn might have when she doesn’t know if a
unicorn-compatible train car is available on the MBTA. This is clearly
not a practical design premise. What it is, is a story so ridiculous and
open to interpretation that it gives participants the license to invent
a solution, however crazy, rather than get stuck in the process. As a
result, folks were able to improvise solutions quickly.

## Present what you’ve learned
Hands-on learning seems like the best method to internalize new concepts
quickly. But to really make sure that our participants are able to
remember and apply their new UX design skills in their work going
forward, we asked them to present their findings at the end of the
workshop. Each team of 5-6 people was asked to pitch their app proposal
to the entire group. They had to explain each proposed interface
solution by stating what user problem they had discovered through
interviews, and how the interface would address that problem.

By “pitching” UX design considerations for the fictional MBTA app, the
participants got practice and gained confidence to do it again in a
future project.

## What’s next

In the follow-up discussion, a participant asked what the next step
might be for someone learning UX design for the first time. We did not
have a prepared answer at the time, except for this: **anyone can and
should include UX design considerations at the beginning of any project
to save time and effort**.

Here is a list of actionable items to further your initial set of skills
so you can start including UX in projects in any discipline:

*   Join UX-oriented Meetups and learn through presentations, networking,
workshops, and panel discussions. DockYard hosts [UX
East](http://www.meetup.com/UX-East/), which includes quarterly
workshops, plus other educational events.
*   Watch [this great introductory
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovj4hFxko7c) that’s drawn on a
whiteboard!
*   Read this article on [Simplicity vs. clarity in UX Design by Robert
Hoekman
Jr.](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/simplicity-is-overrated-in-ux-design/)
*   Read IDEO’s primer on Design Thinking, [The Field Guide to Human Centered
Design](http://www.designkit.org/resources/1), available in print or as a free PDF
*   Read Erika Hall’s A Book Apart book, [Just Enough
Research](https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research), a solid
introduction to the why’s and how’s of design research

## This was fun. Let’s do it again!
The workshop results surpassed our expectation: every group put together
a fun, articulate presentation with their UX considerations for a
fictional app. We saw many fun creative ideas, as well as “aha” moments
where an obvious problem and a simple solution found a match. We had a
great group of students, and saw a lot of results in the two hours they
invested into learning with us.
