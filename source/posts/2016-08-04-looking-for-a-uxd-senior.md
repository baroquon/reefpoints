If you have a passion for HTML and CSS we want you at DockYard!

Weâ€™re a premiere design-first web consultancy based in Boston and we are looking for DockYarders to join our growing team.

Our workflow involves three steps. Designers hand off mockups to the HTML/CSS specialists who then give styled templates to engineers. Traditionally writing HTML and CSS was the responsibility of designers or engineers but with the growth of HTML5 and CSS you need a role within the team solely focused on HTML and CSS.

As an HTML & CSS specialist at DockYard you will be in a unique position where you will work closely and engage in great communication with both the Design team and Engineering team to help facilitate the handoff between visual design and app implementation. Additionally to that, you'll be challenged with helping drive the creation of web applications and solving interesting problems regarding accessibility, browser compatibility, standards compliance, and responsive design.
